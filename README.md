# DotFiles

This repo contains number of configs I use every day. It was created for easy sharing configuration between my desktop, netbook and other machines I use sometimes.

Installation is simple:

    git clone git://github.com/ming13/dotfiles.git
    sh install.sh
    sh post-install.sh

Thatâ€™s all. Updating is the same, scripts must do all hard and boring work themselves.

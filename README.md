# DotFiles

This repo contains number of configs I use every day. It was created for 
easy sharing configuration between my desktop, netbook and other machines 
I use sometimes.

Installation is simple:

    git clone git://github.com/ming13/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    make install

Thatâ€™s all. Updating is pretty like that:

    git pull
    make install

`make install` is for cases when there are new configs or something like.
